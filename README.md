# vireo-manual

This a [workflowr][] project, `vireo-manual`, aims to introduce the method 
`vireo` (Variational Inference for Reconstructing Ensemble Origin), and how to 
use it to

* **demultiplex** your pooled single-cell RNA-seq data easily, no matter without
  or with (part) genotype reference.
* **evaluate** experiment designs with our simulator, e.g., number of sequenced 
  reads, donors, and loading cells
* **reproduce** all analyses we presented in the manuscript.
